# NSB6TopShelf

update 6/19/2019; I recommend looking at my NServiceBusGenericHost repo instead of this one at this point. GenricHost seems to be the way of the future and is a cleaner approach.

This is a template project that can be a starter for a self hosted NSB endpoint.  Due to the variety of hosting options NSB.Host is deprecated and the recommended approach is to self host for new endpoints.  This is based off of the Particular guidance for creating a windows service using TopShelf .
